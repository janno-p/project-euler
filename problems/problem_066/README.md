# Problem 66: Diophantine equation #

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

x<sup>2</sup> – Dy<sup>2</sup> = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is
649<sup>2</sup> – 13&times;180<sup>2</sup> = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

3<sup>2</sup> – 2&times;2<sup>2</sup> = 1  
2<sup>2</sup> – 3&times;1<sup>2</sup> = 1  
9<sup>2</sup> – 5&times;4<sup>2</sup> = 1  
5<sup>2</sup> – 6&times;2<sup>2</sup> = 1  
8<sup>2</sup> – 7&times;3<sup>2</sup> = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D &le; 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D &le; 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is
obtained.
