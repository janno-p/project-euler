# Problem 91 #

The points P (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and Q (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) are plotted at
integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form &Delta;OPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each
co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is, 0 &le; x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>,
x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> &le; 2.

![Triangles 0-2](http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_091_2.gif)

Given that 0 &le; x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> &le; 50, how many right
triangles can be formed?
